<h2>Welcome to Hack-a-fun!</h2>

<p> Welcome to the Hack-a-fun app. If you are reading this you, then you are about to take part in hackathons with a difference!
    This app is run in conjuction with School of Code and is open to all current and past Bootcampers.
    Here you will work with a randomised group of fellow bootcampers, recent graduates and a mentor to solve a Hackathon.
    New hackathons go live every 4 weeks. Sign up if you are interested. You will then be assigned into a group. 
    Your team  will then have access to the GitHub repo for that Hackathon.
    Once your team had completed the hackathon you can save it, make a video about it and add it to your portfolio.
    Have fun and remember - it is all about working and learning together!  </p>
