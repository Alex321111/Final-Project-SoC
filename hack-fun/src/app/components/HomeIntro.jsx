        Welcome to the Hack-a-fun app. You are about to take part in hackathons
        with a difference! Here you will work with a randomised group of fellow
        School of Code bootcampers, recent graduates and a mentor to solve a
        Hackathon. New hackathons go live every 4 weeks. Sign up if you are
        interested. You will then be assigned into a group. Your team will then
        have access to the GitHub repo for that Hackathon. Once your team had
        completed the hackathon you can Save it! Make a video about it! Add it
        to your portfolio. Have fun and remember - it is all about working and
        learning together!
